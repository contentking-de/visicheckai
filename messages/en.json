    "whyAiVisTitle": "Why AI Search Visibility matters",
    "whyAiVisCol1": "Visibility used to start with a position on page 1 of Google – today it begins in AI-generated answers that often require no click at all. Users ask their questions directly to AI systems, receive a curated answer, and make their decision without ever seeing your website or a search result. If you don't appear in those answers, you're effectively invisible – even if your website still has good SEO rankings.",
    "whyAiVisCol2": "At the same time, AI systems select only a few brands as references and keep returning to these preferred sources. Companies that are present in the AI context today become part of the dataset that models learn from, while invisible brands are barely considered in future answers. Visibility in AI answers therefore means more leads, lower acquisition costs, and stronger brand authority, because AI only recommends reliable sources.",

    "faqTitle": "Frequently asked questions",
    "faqSubtitle": "Everything you need to know about brand visibility in AI models.",
    "faq1Q": "What does 'brand visibility in AI models' mean?",
    "faq1A": "Brand visibility in AI models describes how often and in what context your brand appears in responses from AI systems – for example in product recommendations, industry questions or problem solving.\n\nExamples of such systems include OpenAI (with ChatGPT), Google (Gemini) or Perplexity AI.",
    "faq2Q": "Why is this topic becoming important right now?",
    "faq2A": "More and more users are asking purchase and research questions directly to AI assistants instead of traditional search engines. If your brand doesn't appear there, you practically don't exist for this audience.\n\nIn short: AI is a new discovery channel.",
    "faq3Q": "How do AI models decide which brands to mention?",
    "faq3A": "AI models don't access your marketing in real-time but are based on:\n\n• Public web content\n• Press articles & trade media\n• Product reviews & forums\n• Structured company information\n• Brand consistency across many sources\n\nThe more frequently and clearly your brand appears in relevant contexts, the higher the chance of being mentioned.",
    "faq4Q": "Is this the same as SEO?",
    "faq4A": "Not exactly.\n\nSEO optimizes for rankings in search engines. AI visibility optimizes for mentions in responses.\n\nDifferences:\n• No traditional rankings\n• Less focus on keywords\n• More focus on entities, authority and context\n• Brand strength matters more than individual pages\n\nMany already refer to this as GEO (Generative Engine Optimization).",
    "faq5Q": "Can you directly 'optimize' AI models?",
    "faq5A": "You can't directly manipulate them — but you can influence the data they train on or cite from:\n\n• High-quality PR content\n• Mentions in trade media\n• Structured content (e.g. Wikidata, Knowledge Panels)\n• Expert contributions\n• Consistent brand positioning\n\nIt's more reputation building than traditional technical optimization.",
    "faq6Q": "How do I measure my brand visibility in AI?",
    "faq6A": "Typical methods:\n\n• Regular prompt tests ('Which providers for X are there?')\n• Share-of-voice analyses across different AI systems\n• Comparison with competitors\n• Tracking brand mentions in AI responses\n• Combination with traditional digital PR monitoring\n\nThat's exactly what visicheck.ai was built for.",
    "faq7Q": "Which industries benefit the most?",
    "faq7A": "Currently especially:\n\n• SaaS & Tech\n• E-Commerce\n• Consulting & Services\n• Healthcare\n• Finance\n• B2B solutions with complex products\n\nAnywhere users ask complex questions.",
    "faq8Q": "What happens if my brand isn't mentioned?",
    "faq8A": "Then a competitor takes the attention — even if your product is objectively better.\n\nAI responses appear authoritative. Whoever is mentioned gains trust.",
    "faq9Q": "How long does it take to see results?",
    "faq9A": "This is not a quick-win channel.\n\nRealistically:\n• First effects: 2–3 months\n• Noticeable presence: 3–6 months\n• Sustainable visibility: ongoing process\n\nIt closely resembles building thought leadership.",
    "faq10Q": "Is this just a trend?",
    "faq10A": "Very likely not.\n\nAI response systems are increasingly being integrated into operating systems, browsers and search engines. Brand visibility in AI will become as fundamental as SEO was 15 years ago.",
